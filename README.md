#Class Diagram and constraints
This has been done as an assignment for the course "Generative Software Engineering" course in the M.Sc curriculam at Bauhaus University, Weimar. In this section, a sample class diagram of an IT solution
company has been designed with associations and composition. OCLs have also been implemented with both passing and failing instances declared in this model.
